          I earned over $300k from one online course and I can show you how I did it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite the fact that I didn't have a lot of followers,
          didn't have a lot of time and I wasn't sure anyone 
          would pay for my online course...I launched my first 
          online course in 2013 and people paid.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was happy that I had found a way to impact others 
          and still make money and this led me to quit my 9-5 
          and I jumped into full time entrepreneurship.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started launching multiple online courses and as 
          you can imagine, I made so many mistakes in the 
          process until I discovered my proven framework for getting customers to pay for my online course.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that I've figured it out, I now help other course 
          creators to earn $100k.

          Steph helped with a mindset shift in pricing my course the right 
          way. Pricing my course with the value that it offers to users not 
          underpricing or overpricing the course. It doesn't matter what 
          competition is doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my course launch, I had a few fears and Steph said 
          something that was very profound. It felt like the Holy Spirit 
          speaking to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          My focus changed from fearing that people will not pay to having 
          faith that I will attract the right people who can pay for my course 
          and that's exactly what happened.
        </p>
        <p>
          I launched my online course and got 23 students with an email 
          list of 200 people. 
          <strong>
            To date, Over 300 students have paid for 
            my course and it's still selling.

          In 2020, during the Pandemic, my business grew. I took on so 
          many one on one coaching clients and on some days I would 
          have 3, 2 hour coaching sessions with female executives. I was 
          exhausted.
        </p>
        <p>
          After coaching for 6 hours straight, sometimes even 8 hours, I 
          wouldn't want to talk to another human being. All I did was coach 
          and eat in between.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before I knew it, my friendships started to suffer and I gained so 
          much weight, I became embarrassed to leave the house. My 
          mum came to stay with me and complained bitterly about my 
          long working hours and about my incredible weight gain (you 
          can trust our African mothers).
        </p>
        <p>
          So I decided to work with Stephanie Obi.
          <strong>
            This year alone, my course has earned over $30k
          </strong>
          and it's still selling.

      <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6">
        <p>
          Before I worked with Stephanie, everything was a struggle for 
          me. I wanted to deliver the best value and impact lives but the 
          money people were paying me was not encouraging.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted to increase the price of my course but I felt that people 
          would not pay for it because they would not be able to afford my 
          course.
        </p>
        <p>
          After I joined her coaching program, everything changed.
        </p>
        <p>
          - My course got rebranded .
        </p>
        <p>
          - I increased the price of my course by 350%
        </p>
        <p>
          - My course sales skyrocketed and I was able to make much 
          more money.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also started attracting quality clients who were interested in my course.
